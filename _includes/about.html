                    <h3>I am a full stack application developer. I value hard work, difficult problems, and creating solutions that will change the world.</h3>
                    <p>As a developer, I love seeing a product from start to finish. While some developers believe you should pick a speciality and stick with it, I believe I was made to wear many hats and to make them all look good. It's this belief that has driven me to become an okay designer, a not too shabby illustrator, and a professional developer. I am also a husband and father, connoisseur of movies (Never Ending Story, Willo, LOTR), and an advocate for Combos. I currently work as a full stack application developer for Nationwide Childrenâ€™s Hospital located in Columbus, OH. But talk is cheap, so please see my work below to see what I can do.</p>
