sub_header: A promotional microsite for the Columbus Blue Jackets
description: This was a template based application capable of spitting out multiple versions of itself (i.e. a custom lesson) with custom content, images and sounds.  The end product was a Scorm package.  The core of this project was built using Html, CSS/SASS, Javascript/Jquery, and XML.  The deployment of this project was done through the use of an ant-build script in conjunction with custom bat/cmd files that allowed me to deploy multiple versions of the site from the same code base and package each deployment into a Scorm package.
