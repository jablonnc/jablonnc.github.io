description: This was a large scale educational application built in the Flex framework (utilizing the Robotlegs AS3 Micro-Architecture). Â My role on this project covered a wide range of tasks, from creating interactive games that were capable of being tailored on the back-end through our custom CMS to the creation of a calendar that allowed teachers to track what they were reading in the classroom.
