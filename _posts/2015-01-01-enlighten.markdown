title: 'Enlighten'
sub_header: An interactive application geared at children with the purpose of improving the consent/assent process pertaining to potential research subjects.
description: The goal of the Enlighten tablet application is the creation of an experience that is appealing to both parents and children alike, in order to provide consent and assent materials to potential research subjects. Enlighten conveys critical information in a manner which caters to individuals that may prefer auditory or visual learning styles. Comprehension of information is assessed in a measured and reinforced way. Additionally material is humanized via a neutral, animated cartoon avatar. Avatars may be customized to reflect the ethnicity and gender of the user, reinforcing an emotional connection between them and the presentation of the information. Content is also available in translated text and audio for broad localization. Interactive games allow the user to perform procedures they may undergo as part of the research study, decreasing their anxiety of the unknown.
