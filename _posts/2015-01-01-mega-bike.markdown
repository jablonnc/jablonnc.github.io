title: 'Mega Bike'
sub_header: Created two desktop application games that were powered by a child's bike with the intention of encouraging children with Muscular Dystrophy to work out their muscles.
description: It's not very often that you get a project like this that comes along.  I was tasked with creating two interactive games that could be powered by a kids stationary bike.  The overall goal of this project was to motivate the children to ride the bike at home and in return strengthen their muscles.
