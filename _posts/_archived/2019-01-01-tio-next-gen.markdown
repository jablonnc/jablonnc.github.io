Served on the front-end platform team helping to build the next generation Tenable.io (the companies flagship product).
description: In this role I have helped to create high-level solutions that are consumed by our feature teams while also supporting/extending the platform. Most notably, I was able use to simplify our build process and leverage webpack splitting/chunking to trim off 2.5-3 seconds from our initial load time.
